# 🏋️‍♂️ Gym Tracker

A simple, lightweight weekly gym progress tracker. Designed to help users log daily exercises and weights without needing an account or database.

## 📌 Features

- Weekly calendar view with editable weight entries per day.
- Add multiple exercises per day, each with its own name and weight.
- **Collapsible exercise list per day** — toggle visibility to keep the interface clean.
- All data is saved in the browser using `localStorage` — no backend required.
- Reset week button clears all current progress (non-persistent).
- **Planned in 2.0 Version**: Backend with progress analytics to track reps and weight increases over time.

## 🚀 How It Works

- Built with **React** and simple HTML/CSS.
- User data (exercise name and weight per day) is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
- No external APIs or tracking — privacy-focused by default.

## 💼 Note to Recruiters

This is my **first frontend project**, created as a learning exercise to understand React, browser storage, and UI design. While basic in functionality, it's actively being expanded and serves as the foundation for more advanced full-stack features. I'm focused on writing clean, modular code and gradually improving UX responsiveness and visual consistency.
